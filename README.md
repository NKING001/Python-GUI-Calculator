# Python-GUI-Calculator
A Python GUI Calculator built using Tkinter with basic arithmetic operations, percentage, radian conversion, and binary–hexadecimal number conversion.

# 🧮 Python GUI Calculator using Tkinter

This project is a **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Calculator** built using **Python and Tkinter**.  
It performs **basic arithmetic operations** and also supports **number system conversions** such as **Binary to Hexadecimal** and **Hexadecimal to Binary**.

## 🚀 Features

- Simple and clean GUI using Tkinter  
- Supports:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`x`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Clear button (`C`) to reset the display  
- Binary ➝ Hexadecimal conversion  
- Hexadecimal ➝ Binary conversion  
- Button-based input (no keyboard required)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters numbers using digit buttons (`0–9`)
2. User selects an operator (`+`, `-`, `x`, `/`)
3. User presses the `=` button to get the result
4. User presses `C` to clear the display
5. User can use the **Convert** menu for:
   - Binary to Hex
   - Hex to Binary
6. If an invalid value is entered for conversion, **Error** is displayed

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Install Python  
Make sure Python (3.x) is installed on your system.

### Step 2: Run the Program
python calculator.py


A window titled **"NIHAR's Calculator"** will open.
